### Probing Discrete Cosine Transfomation in Images to learn about the coherence/meaning of weights learned by Neural Nets for such transformations
1. Basic ToDo/Done
    + Take a Dataset (eg. Mnist) , convert the images into dct-images, to get the input and output.
    + Desgin a Basic Neural Network (1-hidden layer perceptron) with simple loss function (eg. mse) and inputs/outputs-flattend. 

2. High Level Experiments
    + Different Neural Networks
    + Multiple visualization Techniques


3. Issues
    + Loss function (As DCT preserves information in lower indices, shouldnt the loss functions be designed accordingly)
    + Data-Augmentations is possible (while training)?
